as you can see above.

# working
this progarms works based on the colaborative filtering of the movies using the knn algorithm, i have made a sparse matrix and then check the, we can say likeability of the movies using the cosine distance. That is how it works

# libraries used
i have used pandas, NearestNeighbors, fuzzywuzzy, scipy.sparse
Thank you, as this is my first project i don't expect much from it but i will be trying to upload my projects regularly.
